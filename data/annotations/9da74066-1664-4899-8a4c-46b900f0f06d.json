I remember way back, centuries ago now it must seem, if not to you to me...that I used to try to get people to portray characters that I had created and to say lines that I had given them. It used to sound, often, so strange to me. As if they were not my lines at all and yet they were. But the people very seldom seemed to have the proper intonation, very seldom seemed to be able to put the weight behind the right word to convey the meaning behind the sentence, to give it authority and tone and colour. Invariably people were, with all due respect, very poor mediums. The same applies here using a Medium to communicate with you from this side of life.

It cannot understand the frailties or if it can understand the frailties of the human, it often punishes unnecessarily. We must help each other, we must learn to be more kind, more tolerant. We must try always to put ourselves in the other person's place, try to realise that we have a duty to others. And that the only way we can hope to find our salvation is to be merciful and to be considerate and to give love."}]}],"tags":[{"tag":"Oscar Wilde","category":"Speaker"}],"uuid":"b830d3f6-0e6a-4ed3-9d0a-a1e28409c43a"},{"start_time":1716,"end_time":1719,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Do you have a house yourself where you can write in?"}]}],"tags":[{"tag":"George Woods","category":"Speaker"}],"uuid":"8281d2d2-3cd0-4a15-8332-70dda9531cf7"},{"start_time":1719,"end_time":1736,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Yes I do.
